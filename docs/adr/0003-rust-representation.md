# Map ownership and storage explicitly

- Status: accepted
- Created: 2026-10-31
- Updated: 2026-11-01

C++ pointer arithmetic, mutable visitors, and partially initialized storage
cannot be copied literally into safe Rust. Preserve their defined behavior with
explicit representations while retaining source algorithms.

- A bit reader borrows its bytes. Byte offsets replace pointers, including the
  source's end-minus-eight sentinel. Preserve its 64-bit refill buffer,
  zero-extension, deferred bounds failures, and explicit `close` checkpoint.
  Native Rust moves transfer the close obligation; no copying is provided.
  Debug destruction checks do not raise a second panic during Rust unwinding.
- `Status` maps to `Result<(), StatusCode>` and `StatusOr<T>` to
  `Result<T, StatusCode>`. Success is `Ok`; error codes retain upstream numeric
  values. Error diagnostics and crash-on-error instrumentation are not yet
  translated. Boolean control predicates remain booleans.
  In particular, `AllDefault` consumes a source Status as a branch condition:
  a failed read means false and field visitation continues. Returning early
  with `?` changes partial state and bit consumption; a differential regression
  covers this with an empty, truncated bundle.
- Field visitors mutate borrowed fields. Bundle encoding accepts a mutable
  bundle because upstream's const visitor casts away constness and may update
  `all_default`; do not clone complete bundles to hide that mutation.
- Serialized enums use raw `u32` wrappers implementing `FieldEnum`, so an
  invalid decoded value can be stored and then rejected in the same order as
  C++. Never create an invalid Rust enum discriminant. The templated Enum
  visitor helper is a free function to keep `Visitor` object-safe.
- ANS alias entries retain the eight-byte packed layout and original word
  lookup on little-endian targets. The unaligned word read is contained in
  the lookup with its layout, initialization, and borrow proof. Prefetch uses
  the source's Clang configuration: a T0 read hint on x86_64 with SSE2, disabled
  otherwise. Read top-level preprocessor guards as well as function bodies:
  Highway's SSE2 guard disables its apparent AArch64 builtin branch. Emitting
  an ARM hint would introduce an optimization absent from the reference.
- Entropy readers borrow their code tables for their entire lifetime and take
  a separate mutable bit-reader borrow for each operation. Aligned storage
  owns typed integer/alias slices; local proofs cover initialization, alignment,
  bounds, and exclusive mutable access. The LZ77 window starts initialized as
  required for safe Rust storage; defined decoder reads still follow the
  source's history/zero-distance rules. Keep all state and history counters
  32-bit with explicit wrapping, including the unhealthy-reader path for a
  wrapping decoded run length. Checkpoints restore entropy state and the same
  512 window entries; restoring the bit-reader position remains the caller's
  responsibility. Token bitfields use a private packed `u32` and accessors that
  retain truncation to the source's 31-bit context field. This does not yet
  establish a public C bitfield ABI.
- The inverse move-to-front transform initially translates the existing
  one-lane Highway scalar specialization. Its vector specializations remain
  separate future work; no SIMD or performance parity is inferred from it.
- ANS histogram lookup tables use `OnceLock` with initialized, contiguous
  Rust-owned arrays in place of C++ static initialization. Their formulas,
  numeric widths, and row order stay unchanged; initialization occurs on first
  use under the reference's default floating-point environment. This changes
  storage/initialization timing, not the search algorithm, and does not imply
  memory or performance parity. Keep `f64` rounding and `f32` cost-conversion
  points explicit. C++ `max_element`/`min_element` choose the first equal winner;
  preserve that with strict comparisons, rather than Rust's last-winner
  maximum iterator behavior. Internal writer traits express source Writer
  templates for actual output and bit-count-only estimation.
- Histogram clustering takes mutable input borrows because the C++ const
  interface writes a mutable entropy cache. Preserve those cache changes and
  first-winner ties. A Rust heap uses the original reversed `(cost, first,
  second, version)` ordering; maps retain canonical first-use reindexing. The
  scalar FastLog2f keeps the source coefficients as exact f32 bit patterns,
  integer range reduction, and separate polynomial multiplication/addition.
  Do not replace it with a library logarithm or fused operations. Disjoint
  slice borrows allow merging two histogram entries without cloning the source
  entry solely to satisfy the borrow checker.
- LZ77 retains the RLE, greedy ring-bucket, and optimal hash-chain algorithms,
  including their different special-distance collision winners and first-match
  ties. Owned vectors replace source pointers; initialized match records expose
  only fields assigned by the original dynamic program. The cost tables retain
  exact f32 bits. Upstream disables Clang auto-vectorization; on AArch64 the
  scalar histogram accumulation and final `6 - total_cost * inv_total`
  expression use fused rounding. The Rust mapping makes those rounding sites
  explicit. The x86_64 baseline has no FMA target; this is configuration-specific
  evidence, not cross-target bit parity.
  Differential regressions check all model float bits as well as chosen tokens.
- Huffman node/table pointers become indices into borrowed slices. Leaf nodes
  are sorted by population and descending symbol index, exactly as in C++;
  that comparator is a total order, so the standard library sort's internal
  implementation does not change ties. Temporary tables/arenas are initialized
  before borrowing, and only populated entries are observed. Keep signed
  16-bit node indices, unsigned count wrapping, and the original depth-limiting
  loop. Invalid internal preconditions panic rather than allowing invalid
  memory access; they do not add checks to accepted bitstream parsing. Failed
  parses preserve the source's table resize/mutation order. Symbol reads retain
  the caller's refill obligation and the reader's deferred bounds checkpoint.
- Padded storage preserves the minimum capacity, growth rule, padding, alignment,
  and rotating alignment groups. The initial backend uses Rust's allocator and
  initializes allocated bytes to zero so safe slices never expose uninitialized
  data. Additional initialization is an internal difference, not a promise of
  allocation or performance parity. Custom C allocator callbacks remain
  unported.
- Writer allotment parent pointers become indices in an owned stack. Preserve
  bit budgets, nested charging, and reclaim order. This adds Rust-managed stack
  storage; it does not change the bit-writing algorithm. The scoped callback
  receives reborrows of both the writer and optional accounting context, so
  nested writes can charge the same context without aliased mutable references.
- Complete entropy encoding retains optional output versus size-only writers,
  transposition, scalar token-cost counting, config candidate order, nested
  accounting, and prior histogram/context prefixes. The scalar MaxVectorSize
  value is four bytes; upstream adds that value to a count of u32 elements, and
  the Rust storage keeps the same padding. A newly encoded histogram writer is
  locally owned during table construction and appended even on error, retaining
  the source's observable partial state without cloning the encoding data.
  Streaming finalization accepts mutable codes because bundle visitors can
  mutate fields, following the existing bundle mapping above. The source's
  release-state fuzzer flag remains false; its debug-only global setter is not
  yet exposed. Ordinary Rust debug/release builds both match that reference.

- Color matrices use typed float/double arrays and a 16-byte aligned temporary,
  preserving source mixed-precision accumulation and inversion order. The
  translated callers have disjoint input/output storage; native borrows express
  that boundary. Ordinary Clang AArch64 expression contraction is explicit,
  including double results later narrowed through `copysignf`. C++ min/max
  operand order and unordered comparisons are retained instead of using Rust's
  different NaN rules. Opsin constants and the A2B cube keep constexpr float
  evaluation. ICC tag output remains byte-oriented, with the original profile
  date, aliasing of curve tags, padding, and unsigned MD5 wrapping. Rust's
  standard formatter supplies the source's default six-significant-digit `%g`
  output, with explicit fixed/exponent selection and C spellings; no C formatter
  is linked. Darwin omits a NaN sign, covered by an exact negative-NaN regression.
  These are reference-configuration results, not cross-platform or SIMD parity.

Retain defined unsigned truncation and wrapping explicitly. Invalid programmer
preconditions must not cause undefined behavior in Rust. Record any discovered
source ambiguity before changing its interpretation. Do not add blanket unsafe
code or blanket lint suppression to imitate C++ syntax.

Review these mappings when adding the C ABI, custom allocators, nested bundle
extensions, SIMD, or concurrency. Image kernels must not assume that the current
pilot establishes their numeric or memory behavior.
