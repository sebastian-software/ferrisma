# Map ownership and storage explicitly

- Status: accepted
- Created: 2026-10-31
- Updated: 2026-10-31

C++ pointer arithmetic, mutable visitors, and partially initialized storage
cannot be copied literally into safe Rust. Preserve their defined behavior with
explicit representations while retaining source algorithms.

- A bit reader borrows its bytes. Byte offsets replace pointers, including the
  source's end-minus-eight sentinel. Preserve its 64-bit refill buffer,
  zero-extension, deferred bounds failures, and explicit `close` checkpoint.
  Native Rust moves transfer the close obligation; no copying is provided.
  Debug destruction checks do not raise a second panic during Rust unwinding.
- `Status` maps to `Result<(), StatusCode>` and `StatusOr<T>` to
  `Result<T, StatusCode>`. Success is `Ok`; error codes retain upstream numeric
  values. Error diagnostics and crash-on-error instrumentation are not yet
  translated. Boolean control predicates remain booleans.
  In particular, `AllDefault` consumes a source Status as a branch condition:
  a failed read means false and field visitation continues. Returning early
  with `?` changes partial state and bit consumption; a differential regression
  covers this with an empty, truncated bundle.
- Field visitors mutate borrowed fields. Bundle encoding accepts a mutable
  bundle because upstream's const visitor casts away constness and may update
  `all_default`; do not clone complete bundles to hide that mutation.
- Serialized enums use raw `u32` wrappers implementing `FieldEnum`, so an
  invalid decoded value can be stored and then rejected in the same order as
  C++. Never create an invalid Rust enum discriminant. The templated Enum
  visitor helper is a free function to keep `Visitor` object-safe.
- ANS alias entries retain the eight-byte packed layout and original word
  lookup on little-endian targets. The unaligned word read is contained in
  the lookup with its layout, initialization, and borrow proof. Prefetch uses
  the source's Clang configuration: a T0 read hint on x86_64 with SSE2, disabled
  otherwise. Read top-level preprocessor guards as well as function bodies:
  Highway's SSE2 guard disables its apparent AArch64 builtin branch. Emitting
  an ARM hint would introduce an optimization absent from the reference.
- Entropy readers borrow their code tables for their entire lifetime and take
  a separate mutable bit-reader borrow for each operation. Aligned storage
  owns typed integer/alias slices; local proofs cover initialization, alignment,
  bounds, and exclusive mutable access. The LZ77 window starts initialized as
  required for safe Rust storage; defined decoder reads still follow the
  source's history/zero-distance rules. Keep all state and history counters
  32-bit with explicit wrapping, including the unhealthy-reader path for a
  wrapping decoded run length. Checkpoints restore entropy state and the same
  512 window entries; restoring the bit-reader position remains the caller's
  responsibility. Token bitfields use a private packed `u32` and accessors that
  retain truncation to the source's 31-bit context field. This does not yet
  establish a public C bitfield ABI.
- The inverse move-to-front transform initially translates the existing
  one-lane Highway scalar specialization. Its vector specializations remain
  separate future work; no SIMD or performance parity is inferred from it.
- ANS histogram lookup tables use `OnceLock` with initialized, contiguous
  Rust-owned arrays in place of C++ static initialization. Their formulas,
  numeric widths, and row order stay unchanged; initialization occurs on first
  use under the reference's default floating-point environment. This changes
  storage/initialization timing, not the search algorithm, and does not imply
  memory or performance parity. Keep `f64` rounding and `f32` cost-conversion
  points explicit. C++ `max_element`/`min_element` choose the first equal winner;
  preserve that with strict comparisons, rather than Rust's last-winner
  maximum iterator behavior. Internal writer traits express source Writer
  templates for actual output and bit-count-only estimation.
- Huffman node/table pointers become indices into borrowed slices. Leaf nodes
  are sorted by population and descending symbol index, exactly as in C++;
  that comparator is a total order, so the standard library sort's internal
  implementation does not change ties. Temporary tables/arenas are initialized
  before borrowing, and only populated entries are observed. Keep signed
  16-bit node indices, unsigned count wrapping, and the original depth-limiting
  loop. Invalid internal preconditions panic rather than allowing invalid
  memory access; they do not add checks to accepted bitstream parsing. Failed
  parses preserve the source's table resize/mutation order. Symbol reads retain
  the caller's refill obligation and the reader's deferred bounds checkpoint.
- Padded storage preserves the minimum capacity, growth rule, padding, alignment,
  and rotating alignment groups. The initial backend uses Rust's allocator and
  initializes allocated bytes to zero so safe slices never expose uninitialized
  data. Additional initialization is an internal difference, not a promise of
  allocation or performance parity. Custom C allocator callbacks remain
  unported.
- Writer allotment parent pointers become indices in an owned stack. Preserve
  bit budgets, nested charging, and reclaim order. This adds Rust-managed stack
  storage; it does not change the bit-writing algorithm. The scoped callback
  receives reborrows of both the writer and optional accounting context, so
  nested writes can charge the same context without aliased mutable references.

Retain defined unsigned truncation and wrapping explicitly. Invalid programmer
preconditions must not cause undefined behavior in Rust. Record any discovered
source ambiguity before changing its interpretation. Do not add blanket unsafe
code or blanket lint suppression to imitate C++ syntax.

Review these mappings when adding the C ABI, custom allocators, nested bundle
extensions, SIMD, or concurrency. Image kernels must not assume that the current
pilot establishes their numeric or memory behavior.
