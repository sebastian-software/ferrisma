# Map ownership and storage explicitly

- Status: accepted
- Created: 2026-10-31
- Updated: 2026-10-31

C++ pointer arithmetic, mutable visitors, and partially initialized storage
cannot be copied literally into safe Rust. Preserve their defined behavior with
explicit representations while retaining source algorithms.

- A bit reader borrows its bytes. Byte offsets replace pointers, including the
  source's end-minus-eight sentinel. Preserve its 64-bit refill buffer,
  zero-extension, deferred bounds failures, and explicit `close` checkpoint.
  Native Rust moves transfer the close obligation; no copying is provided.
  Debug destruction checks do not raise a second panic during Rust unwinding.
- `Status` maps to `Result<(), StatusCode>` and `StatusOr<T>` to
  `Result<T, StatusCode>`. Success is `Ok`; error codes retain upstream numeric
  values. Error diagnostics and crash-on-error instrumentation are not yet
  translated. Boolean control predicates remain booleans.
  In particular, `AllDefault` consumes a source Status as a branch condition:
  a failed read means false and field visitation continues. Returning early
  with `?` changes partial state and bit consumption; a differential regression
  covers this with an empty, truncated bundle.
- Field visitors mutate borrowed fields. Bundle encoding accepts a mutable
  bundle because upstream's const visitor casts away constness and may update
  `all_default`; do not clone complete bundles to hide that mutation.
- Serialized enums use raw `u32` wrappers implementing `FieldEnum`, so an
  invalid decoded value can be stored and then rejected in the same order as
  C++. Never create an invalid Rust enum discriminant. The templated Enum
  visitor helper is a free function to keep `Visitor` object-safe.
- ANS alias entries retain the eight-byte packed layout and original word
  lookup on little-endian targets. The unaligned word read is contained in
  the lookup with its layout, initialization, and borrow proof. Prefetch is
  not yet exposed; no no-op hint substitutes for the source implementation.
- Huffman node/table pointers become indices into borrowed slices. Leaf nodes
  are sorted by population and descending symbol index, exactly as in C++;
  that comparator is a total order, so the standard library sort's internal
  implementation does not change ties. Temporary tables/arenas are initialized
  before borrowing, and only populated entries are observed. Keep signed
  16-bit node indices, unsigned count wrapping, and the original depth-limiting
  loop. Invalid internal preconditions panic rather than allowing invalid
  memory access; they do not add checks to accepted bitstream parsing. Failed
  parses preserve the source's table resize/mutation order. Symbol reads retain
  the caller's refill obligation and the reader's deferred bounds checkpoint.
- Padded storage preserves the minimum capacity, growth rule, padding, alignment,
  and rotating alignment groups. The initial backend uses Rust's allocator and
  initializes allocated bytes to zero so safe slices never expose uninitialized
  data. Additional initialization is an internal difference, not a promise of
  allocation or performance parity. Custom C allocator callbacks remain
  unported.
- Writer allotment parent pointers become indices in an owned stack. Preserve
  bit budgets, nested charging, and reclaim order. This adds Rust-managed stack
  storage; it does not change the bit-writing algorithm. The scoped callback
  receives reborrows of both the writer and optional accounting context, so
  nested writes can charge the same context without aliased mutable references.

Retain defined unsigned truncation and wrapping explicitly. Invalid programmer
preconditions must not cause undefined behavior in Rust. Record any discovered
source ambiguity before changing its interpretation. Do not add blanket unsafe
code or blanket lint suppression to imitate C++ syntax.

Review these mappings when adding the C ABI, custom allocators, nested bundle
extensions, SIMD, or concurrency. Image kernels must not assume that the current
pilot establishes their numeric or memory behavior.
